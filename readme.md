## Project Summary
For this project, we created an informative, engaging WordPress site focused around the Greek Mythos. Our site has 3 main focuses, from news relating to the myths to informing visitors about different characters and settings in traditional myths to keeping them up to date on the site and its staff. The site has an optional contact form to share feedback and questions with the team, as well as an optional newsletter that will let visitors stay abreast of any new updates to the site or relevant information outside the scope of the site.
