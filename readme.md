## Project Summary

For this project, we created an informative, engaging WordPress site focused around the Greek Mythos. Our site has 3 main focuses, from stories relating to the myths of Greek heroes and gods, to informing visitors about different characters and settings in traditional myths, to creating monthly web themes and small summaries centered around one specific Greek god or hero every month. An example would be in our website, our special theme that the user could turn on is centered around Artemis, and they could go to a page that shows more information about the goddess and her importance. The site has an optional contact form to share feedback and questions with the team, as well as an optional newsletter that will let visitors stay abreast of any new updates to the site or relevant information outside the scope of the site.

## Core Templates

# Template One: Home

# Template Two: About

- Our About template will discuss how the website came to be developed, as well as discuss the creators ambitions for the site and personalities briefly.

# Template Three: Contact

- The Contact template will operate as a way for users to send messages to the creators of the site, whether their messages purpose be to ask questions, provide feedback, or report scammers.

# Template Four: Blog Home

- The Blog Home template will discuss the most recent or popular blogs that people are currently looking at on the site. Users can click on the links to view the actual blog post to read more information.

# Template Five: Post

- After the user clicks a link to a blog post on the Blog Home template, the user will be able to look at this template to actually read the post in detail.

# Template Six: News Home

- The News Home template is similar to the Blog Home template in organization. The most recent or popular news articles that users can click on to read more information.

# Template Seven: News Post

- Similar to the Post template, this template will appear afer the user clicks on a specific post that was listed in the News Home template.

# Template Eight: Error 404

- The error 404 template is meant to appear to users that may encounter an error while navigating our site. This error could appear if the page is frozen or the user clicks a previously deleted article by mistake.

# Template Nine: Monthy Greek Mythos (May) (Artemis)

- One of the gimmicks of the site is that supposedly each month there will be a section of the website dedicated to a Greek Hero, God/Goddess, or mythological legend. The user can switch to a web theme that reflects the colors of that Greek character or setting, as well as a template dedicated to telling extra stories or interesting facts about the subject of the month.
